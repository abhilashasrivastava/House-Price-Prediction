# House-Price-Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using machine learning algorithms. It includes the development of a prediction model and a user-friendly web application using Flask.

Features
Prediction Model: Developed a real estate pricing prediction model by analyzing historical house prices, property characteristics, and market trends to identify significant factors influencing prices.
Machine Learning Expertise: Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to determine the optimal model for accurate price predictions.
Flask Web Application: Built a user-friendly web application using Python Flask Server, enabling users to input property details and receive estimated prices based on the trained model.
Usage
Data Analysis: Before running the prediction model, ensure that you have analyzed the historical house prices and relevant property characteristics to understand the dataset's structure and trends.
Model Training: Train the prediction model using the provided dataset and machine learning algorithms. Evaluate different algorithms to determine the most suitable model for accurate price predictions.
Flask Server Setup: Set up a Flask server to host the web application. Make sure to install Flask and any required dependencies.
Web Application Deployment: Deploy the Flask web application, allowing users to input property details and receive estimated prices based on the trained model.
User Interaction: Users can interact with the web application by entering property details such as location, size, number of rooms, etc., and obtaining estimated prices instantly.
Requirements
Python (3.x recommended)
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
Flask
HTML/CSS (for web application frontend)
Deployment
Ensure that the Flask server is properly configured and deployed to a hosting environment accessible to users. Monitor the application for performance and scalability as needed.
